# Show a notification with sound when agent has completed processing a request and has a final answer for me to review

- Sometimes, agent requests need time to process and I would like perform other tasks while this is happening
- Please show a notification with sound to indicate that a request has been completed and I have an answer / new tested suggestions to review.
- Do not show this notification until all cycles are completed as specified in [build-and-test.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/build-and-test.mdc)
