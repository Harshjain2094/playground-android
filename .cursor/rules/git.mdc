# Git branching and commit rules

## General instructions
1. never commit directly to the `master` or `main` branch


## Branch conventions
1. follow a branch naming convention like so `<PODS-XXXX>/<my initials>/<short-description>` 
2. when no jira ticket number is available, use `NO-JIRA`

e.g. 
  - Kaushik Gopal adding cursor rules should use a branch `NO-JIRA/kg/cursor-rules`
  - Michal P working on a new USF feature should use a branch `PODS-5432/mp/usf-v3`

## Commit message conventions

1. commit message subject should not be longer than 50 characters
2. Wrap lines at 72 characters
3. In the footer part, feel free to add additional information, such as references to issues or supporting links or docs that were consulted in the process of working on the code
4. commit message should begin with the JIRA ticket name, followed by a colon.  For the above examples:
  - Kaushik Gopal adding cursor rules could use a commit message such as: `NO-JIRA: Created some new Cursor rules`
  - Michal P working on a new USF feature could use a commit message such as: `PODS-5432: Added framework for new USF flow`
