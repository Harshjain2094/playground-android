# Git branching and commit rules

1. never commit directly to the `master` or `main` branch
2. follow a branch naming convention like so `<PODS-XXXX>/<my initials>/<short-description>` 
3. when no jira ticket number is available, use `NO-JIRA`

e.g. 
  - Kaushik Gopal adding cursor rules should use a branch `NO-JIRA/kg/cursor-rules`
  - Michal P working on a new USF feature should use a branch `PODS-5432/mp/usf-v3`
  -
