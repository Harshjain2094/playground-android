# Unit testing rules and libraries

- We need unit tests to cover all new code in order for our CI to pass, usually we need at least 85% coverage on important files such as ViewModels.
- We use Turbine and Mockito as our main testing libraries.
- We never use Robolectric or Mockk, please do not suggest anything involving these testing libraries.
